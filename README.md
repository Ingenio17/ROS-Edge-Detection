# ROS-Edge-Detection

Hello Everyone,<br>
I am Saumya Shah, from IIT Bombay and this is my MRT Assignment<br>
The task was to perform real-time edge detection using Python through ROS & OpenCV<br>
I have added my publisher and subscriber codes here<br>
The <b><I>F1Onboards.mp4</I></b> file is too big to upload here, so, I am attaching the link to the video, you can download it and try for yourself:<br>
<i>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWaDwAZffW8</i> <br>
You can also use any other compatible video file and add its path inside <b><I>cv2.VideoCapture()</I></b> in <b><I>publisher.py</I></b> <br>
If you want to use your webcam, just put 0 instead of the path above
